If you are looking for a .yml file, you are likely planning to use GitHub Actions to automate the hosting of your Valentine's page on GitHub Pages. This is the most professional way to do it—it ensures that every time you update your code, the website updates automatically.

🚀 The GitHub Actions Workflow (deploy.yml)
Create a folder in your project called .github and a subfolder called workflows. Save this code as static.yml inside that folder.

YAML
name: Deploy Valentine Site to Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"] # Runs every time you push to the main branch

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          # Upload the entire repository (since index.html is in the root)
          path: '.'

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
